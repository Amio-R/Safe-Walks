# Safe-Walks
Enghack 2018 Submission by myself, Jason Surendran, Amio Rahman, Jason Ma. It is a project using the android things core and a javascript web app to send motion sensor data from jaywalkers to nearby officers and traffic analysts via texts.
Final system was not finished during the hackathon. At the moment the Android Things app running on the raspberry pi runs independently of the web data parser. Will be updated once we finish.
